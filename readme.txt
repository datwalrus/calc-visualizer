This project is developed under an intended use case of easily detailing the simplification of various expressions, algebraic and otherwise, in a similar fashion to existing online equation/expression solvers.

Packages are separated based on use-case:

calculations: all mathmatic methods, and applicable data structures.
              used to simplify expressions and solve equations

gui:          all gui components (not started)

pdfconv:      all pdf converter components (not started)
